# Binkenlights

A LED display for pixel art animations.

This project builds on [Matt Lai's LED matrix board] to create a display
for ASCII art animations.

Coupled with a companion webapp and corresponding back-end (which are in the works),
it can be used by groups of people to share animations and create a sense of shared
space despite being physically distant.
